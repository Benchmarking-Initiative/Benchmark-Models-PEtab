- CBSD model was fit to simulated data from the CBS model
- `equilibration` condition appears to be 100 time units of preequilibration - but has measurements
- How to visualise Fig 2c as PEtab `BarPlot` does not allow offset between observables on x scale
- How to match Figure 2B: CBSD model fit to CBS model simulated data
- zeb1 measurements do not match Fig S3B
- snail1 measurements after t 100 missing

# Supp. Figure descriptions:

S3 Fig. Detailed fits of the CBSD model under the DLC1 siCtrl condition show good agreement with the sampled data.

A. Fits of the CBSD model to ZEB1 with 1.5 ng/ml TGFβ. Fitting to a medium exogenous TGFβ concentration ensured an accurate allocation of the partial state. B. Fits of the CBSD model with 10 ng/ml exogenous TGFβ to sampled data points of the CBS model. dlc1 was fitted to a stable concentration calculated relative to the stable snail1 concentration, according to our qPCR data.

S4 Fig. Fit of the CBSD model under dlc1 knockdown.

The stars represent expected stable fold-changes of dlc1 and snail1 upon dlc1 knockdown between approximate days 2 and 7.
